How to run (short)

Generate VAPID keys (in a terminal):

npx web-push generate-vapid-keys


Copy the public and private keys into backend/.env as VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY and VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY, and put the public key in frontend/.env as REACT_APP_VAPID_PUBLIC.

Backend:

cd backend

Copy .env.example → .env and fill values (Mongo URI, SMTP, VAPID keys)

npm install

npm run dev (or npm start)

Frontend:

cd frontend

create .env with REACT_APP_API_BASE and REACT_APP_VAPID_PUBLIC

npm install

npm start

Open http://localhost:3000 for the React app. The backend runs on http://localhost:5000.

Notes, caveats & recommendations

Security: Do not store SMTP or VAPID keys in client code. Use environment variables. If you later deploy, use secure secrets management.

Push subscription persistence: We store subscriptions in DB (Subscription model). Tie them to users for targeted pushes.

Scaling scheduler: Current scheduler polls every minute. For many reminders or multi-instance setups, consider:

Using a persistent job queue (BullMQ / Redis + workers)

Scheduling per-reminder jobs (e.g., agenda.js) or using provider scheduling (Firebase Cloud Functions)

Timezones: Frontend sends ISO strings — implement timezone handling if needed (store timezone per user).

Retry & delivery logs: Store notification logs to retry failed deliveries and for audit.



If you want, I can now:

generate the exact full code files in a zip (I can produce them as single message blocks or create a downloadable archive if you want files), or

expand any module (e.g., add authentication, better UI, admin dashboard, or queue-based scheduling), or

provide Postman collection / curl commands to test the APIs.
